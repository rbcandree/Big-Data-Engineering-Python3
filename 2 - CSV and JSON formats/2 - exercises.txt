#1 Python module os contains some important operating system features that we need while handling files in Python.

a) Import the module and use os.getcwd to get the current working directory and print that on screen.
b) Afterward change the working directory with os.chdir("path_to_the_new_directory").
c) Use os.listdir() to check the contents of your current working directory.

#2 Reading CSV files
Let's assume we have a file grades.csv, which contains names of students and the grades they received on some courses. ‘;’ is used as the csv delimiter in this file. The file is in the following format:

Paul;5;4;5;3;4;5;5;4;2;4

Beth;3;4;2;4;4;2;3;1;3;3

Ruth;4;5;5;4;5;5;4;5;4;4

Implement a program that reads through the data, calculates average grade for each student and calculates overall average of grades for the whole class. The program outputs the students name, their grades and the average. The program also outputs the overall average of grades for whole class. You can use the previous 3 students grades as test input.
Expected output:

Grades for Paul: 5 4 5 3 4 5 5 4 2 4

Average for Paul: 4.1

Grades for Beth: 3 4 2 4 4 2 3 1 3 3

Average for Beth: 2.9

Grades for Ruth: 4 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 4 4

Average for Ruth: 4.5

*****
Average of the class: 3.83

#3 Implement a program that opens weather-data.json shared in itslearning. You can open this file from your own hard drive like this:
*notice the use of the escape character \ in front of the directory path steps.

import json
with open('d:\\username\\yourfolder\\weather-data.json') as fh:
data =json.load(fh)

Find out programmatically how many KUITUVASTE_SUURI_1 measurements have been made. You may need to have a look at the json file to find out how to handle it in Python.

#4 Acquire the JSON file from:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

Implement a function that explores the form of the JSON file and outputs the following information:
-The keys used in the dictionary
-The number of completed tasks
-The number of tasks with the word "delectus" in their title

The related user information can be found from:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Use these 2 JSON files and programmatically find out the names of the users with the most completed tasks. You can assume that the id in the users -JSON refers to the userID in the todos JSON.
