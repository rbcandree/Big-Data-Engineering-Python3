Timestamps are important for data preprocessing. Familiarize yourself
with Pythons datetime module. A decent tutorial can be found here:
https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-datetime-usage/

#1
Write a program that prints the following information on screen:

a) 
You can do certain algebraic operations on datetime objects.
Create 2 separate datetime objects that refer to different points
in time and explore the results of following operations:
dt_obj_1 - dt_obj_2
dt_obj_1 < dt_obj_2

What can you tell about the - and < operators for datatime objects?
Write a couple sentences in your own words.

b)
Print the current time in epoch format on screen. What kind of
operations are available for time represented in epoch format?

Convert the seconds since epoch to a more human readable format and
print that also on the screen.

#2
Given a string "2020-09-28  18:47:50", convert the string into a
datetime object. Access the objects year, month, day and hour attributes
separately and print the results on screen. Raise all of these values
by one. Convert the resulting datetime object into a string of format
YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.

Do the same conversion but with the resulting string in format:
"It's year 2021, day 29 of month 10 and it is 19:47:50."


#3
a)
Find out programmatically which day of the week was on 1.10.1999

b)
Find out programmatically which date (dd.mm.yyyy) is 27 weeks before 1.10.1999

c)
Find out programmatically which day of the week is 157 days after 1.10.1999

(hint: strftime -method may help you with these)
