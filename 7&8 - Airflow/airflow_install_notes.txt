pip install apache airflow

We'll use Astro CLI to here to dodge some of the configuration steps.

Installing the newest version:
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s

can be uninstalled by just removing the directory:
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/astro

Astro expects docker to be installed on the system.
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/
*(install using the apt repository)

When done, remember to run hello-world to make sure that everything is working:
sudo docker run hello-world

systemctl --user enable docker-desktop
systemctl --user stop docker-desktop

mkdir example
cd example
sudo astro dev init

Now that we have docker and astro CLI installed, we are ready to start the project:
sudo astro dev start
Note: you'll need to sudo this. our user isn't in the docker group.

Once everything has been downloaded you can browse to https://localhost:8080/ to check airflowUI.
This takes some time.

This can fail because we already have postgres running in the default port, let's fix this by modifying the config.yaml in our project directorys hidden .astro subdirectory.

Before working with the DAG implemention, make sure you have pandas installed:
pip install pandas

sudo service docker start
